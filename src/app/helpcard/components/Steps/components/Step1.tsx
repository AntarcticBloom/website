      We interview card recipients to create profiles that detail their
      individual situation and needs. We create initiatives around those needs
      in our app to which donors can contribute. Access to pay for the goods and
      services specified in the initiative is granted to the recipient&apos;s
      card.

      Donors can also issue their own cards, conduct interviews, create
      profiles, and create initiatives for recipients.
